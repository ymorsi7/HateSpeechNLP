My best friend (female) who served in Iraq went to dinner downtown and someone attempted to kidnap her. She only got away because her driver was special forces, knew the roads and was trained to handle this particular situation. In certain trainings they simulate torture and often separate women, but not fully out of earshot of the men, so they can hear what’s happening and break their spirits. I would argue it’s not even enough to match the men physically because women become targets in multiple ways.

Here is one reason among many, women lie. Yes they do and for very selfish reasons. I have seen them gang up on a guy they don't like with lying to get them court martialed out of the service. As well as lying about being pregnant or getting pregnant to get out of a deployment. I was on a ship that had berths for 30 women. We routinely got underway of deployment with only one woman. This doubles and triples the load on the men. We were routinely sleep deprived. We would return to base, the women left at home come back and still got sea pay for staying home. Not fair. In addition, any woman in the room outranks every male nt matter what their rank. They also enlist men and boys to help women do their jobs. They are a distraction to the mission as the point of all missions devolves into protecting the woman. Mission be damned.

I started watching some of Andrew's stuff because my 18 yr old daughter was telling me what a misogynistic guy he was. i watched some of his videos in full because of this. I thought a lot of his view points were good. I love being married to a strong masculine man who protects our family. I like that Andrew is encouraging the masculine in young men again. we need our strong men to keep our countries strong.
